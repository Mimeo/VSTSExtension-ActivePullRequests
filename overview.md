## View all pull requests in one place 
This Visual Studio Team Services extension allows you to view all active pull requests across all repositories for a team project. No more clicking through every repo just to see if an open pull request needs your attention. Now simply view all active pull requests with the pull request id, repo, and whether or not you need to take action.
